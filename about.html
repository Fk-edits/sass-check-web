      <p>
        Our school was founded in the year 1995 with a vision to provide quality education to children in our community. 
        What began as a small institution with just a handful of students has now grown into a well-respected center of learning.<br><br>
        Over the years, we have expanded our campus, upgraded our facilities, and introduced modern teaching methods, 
        while still holding on to the core values that make us unique.<br><br>
        Today, we continue to strive for academic excellence, nurturing creativity, critical thinking, and character in every student. 
        We are proud of our journey and excited for what lies ahead.
